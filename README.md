# MyriadBows

This mod adds a **Myriad** enchantment for bows that consumes arrows with a probability depending on the level of the
enchantment.

Needs to be installed both client and server side.

Inspiration from `Xilefian`: https://twitter.com/Xilefian/status/1559534397405253632

- Myriad I: 30% chance to consume an arrow
- Myriad II: 20%
- Myriad III: 10%
